Automated M&A and Market‑Signals Tracking Tool

Objective
Build an automated system that continuously monitors market activity relevant to SilverTree Equity. The system should collect and summarise key signals each week and deliver them as a single email to romil@silvertree-equity.com.

What the Tool Must Track

SilverTree portfolio companies
Competitors of those portfolio companies
Major industry deals (M&A, fundraising, large partnerships)
Automatic carve-out screening: for each major deal, flag whether any business units or product lines could be of potential interest to a private equity firm like SilverTree
Strategic activity:
Transactions announced
New product launches
Personnel changes
Any other developments that impact competitive position
Sources to Monitor
You must propose the complete list of sources. At minimum include:

GP Bullhound press releases
LinkedIn (company pages and leadership updates)
Industry newsfeeds
Your Responsibilities

Propose tracking scope
List all companies, competitor clusters, sectors, and topics you recommend including.
Identify industry news sources and justify why they are relevant.
Build the automated monitoring system
Use tools of your choice: n8n, Make.com, Codewords, Cursor, Python scripts, or a combination.
The system must monitor enough detail for a private equity fund to understand:
What happened
Why it matters
How it affects SilverTree or its portfolio companies
Automated relevance explanation
For every news item, generate a brief auto-summary of why the event is relevant. Examples include:
A competitor launched a new AI-enabled feature that may affect a similar feature in a portfolio company
A leadership change that signals strategic shift
A deal that indicates market consolidation
A deal where part of the target might be an attractive carve-out
Carve-out detection
For each major deal announced, automatically check whether there are business units, product divisions, or non-core assets that might be worth analysing as a potential carve-out opportunity.

Weekly summary email
Automatically generate and send a weekly digest email to romil@silvertree-equity.com including:

Key news items grouped by portfolio company, competitor, and major deals
Relevance explanations
Carve-out flags
Links to original sources
Testing metrics
You will be evaluated on:
Tool performance and reliability over a sample week
The quality and clarity of your relevance tagging and carve-out reasoning
Deliverables

The automated system (workflow files or code)
Documentation explaining how the system works
Your proposed tracking scope
A sample weekly summary email showing the output
