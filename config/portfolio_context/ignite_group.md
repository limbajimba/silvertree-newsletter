## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** grant discovery database or sector-specialist advisory unit carved out from a general consultancy
**ARR/Revenue Range (GBP):** 3m–40m
**Employee Range:** 20–250
**Geography Preference:** Netherlands, Benelux, DACH, Nordics

### Product Lines of Interest
- subsidy alerts
- grant workflow tooling
- sector-specific expertise (energy/innovation)

### Integration Constraints
- data licensing and update processes must be transferable
- avoid heavy dependency on parent’s shared CRM/process stack

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
