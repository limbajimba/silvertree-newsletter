## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** billing/CIS module suite or analytics add-on divested from larger utility IT portfolio
**ARR/Revenue Range (GBP):** 8m–90m
**Employee Range:** 60–700
**Geography Preference:** UK, Europe, ANZ (selective)

### Product Lines of Interest
- billing
- customer care
- tariff mgmt
- meter data integration
- analytics

### Integration Constraints
- carve-outs are harder: require clean separation from shared delivery teams and hosted infrastructure
- must preserve customer SLAs and regulatory compliance
- implementation partner bench is critical

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
