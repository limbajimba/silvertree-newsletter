### Market Context
Platforms that orchestrate onboarding + KYC/AML policy/rules, screening/IDV, and lifecycle reviews for financial institutions.

## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** workflow/case management module, onboarding orchestration, or regional CLM business unit from broader fintech suite

**Employee Range:** 80–800
**Geography Preference:** Europe, UK, Middle East (selective), North America (selective)

### Product Lines of Interest
- KYC orchestration
- rules engine
- case management
- customer onboarding workflows

### Integration Constraints
- must support auditability and model governance
- data residency and secure deployment options
- separation must preserve integrations (screening/IDV/sanctions lists) or provide swap plan

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
