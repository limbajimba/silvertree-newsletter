## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** EA/APM tool or module suite divested from broader IT management portfolio
**ARR/Revenue Range (GBP):** 8m–60m
**Employee Range:** 50–400
**Geography Preference:** Europe, UK, North America (selective)

### Product Lines of Interest
- EA modeling
- APM
- roadmapping
- process modeling
- GRC-adjacent EA

### Integration Constraints
- should support open standards (ArchiMate) and common exports
- SSO/SCIM enterprise readiness required
- avoid assets tightly coupled to parent proprietary platform without clean separation APIs

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
