## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** Email/SMS automation product line, CDP-lite module, or regional martech vendor divested from a broader suite
**ARR/Revenue Range (GBP):** 5m–70m
**Employee Range:** 30–500
**Geography Preference:** Europe, North America

### Product Lines of Interest
- lifecycle automation
- personalization
- CDP activation
- recommendations

### Integration Constraints
- deliverability infrastructure must be separable or replaceable
- data governance and consent tooling required
- avoid products reliant on parent’s identity graph without migration path

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
