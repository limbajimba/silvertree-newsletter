# Thesis - SilverTree Portfolio Company

## Company Overview

**Sector:** Student Information Management for Higher Education
**Market Segment:** Higher Education Student Information Systems (SIS)
**Core Business:** Cloud-based student information systems (SIS) for higher education (UK/Canada/global).
**Website:** https://www.thesiscloud.com/

### Market Context
Core platforms for the student lifecycle (admissions, records, billing, reporting) for universities/colleges.

## Strategic Thesis

### Investment Thesis
SIS is a mission-critical system of record with high switching costs; buyers migrate infrequently but spend heavily when they do. A modern cloud SIS can win replacement cycles and expand into adjacent campus workflows.

### Current Strategic Priority
Win replacements by proving low-risk migration + compliance reporting, and expand implementation capacity via partners to accelerate deployments.

## Competitive Landscape

### Priority Competitors to Monitor

|------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Tribal (SITS) | Strong UK footprint; direct competitor in UK HE. |

| 3 | Workday Student | Suite pull-through risk in institutions adopting Workday. |
| 4 | Anthology Student | Installed base and suite adjacency. |
| 5 | Oracle PeopleSoft Campus Solutions | Legacy incumbent in large institutions; replacement cycles trigger wins/losses. |

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Type |
|------------|------|
| Ellucian | Direct |
| Workday Student | Direct |
| Tribal Group | Direct |
| Jenzabar | Direct |

## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** Student lifecycle module suite or regional SIS business unit within broader ERP vendor
**ARR/Revenue Range (GBP):** 10m–80m
**Employee Range:** 60–500
**Geography Preference:** UK, Ireland, Canada, Nordics

### Product Lines of Interest
- records
- admissions
- fee billing
- statutory reporting
- integration middleware

### Integration Constraints
- data privacy + residency support
- migration tooling and implementation partner bench required
- avoid assets requiring multi-year bespoke rewrites without committed roadmap

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
