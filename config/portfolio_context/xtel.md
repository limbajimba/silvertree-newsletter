## Ideal Carve-Out Profile

**Target Asset Type:** Vertical analytics / optimization module or legacy TPM product line inside a broader planning suite

**Employee Range:** 40–300
**Geography Preference:** UK, Europe, North America (selective)

### Product Lines of Interest
- trade spend management
- promotion optimization
- price/promo/mix analytics
- CPG retailer execution analytics

### Integration Constraints
- must have API or exportable data model
- avoid deep dependency on parent-company shared data lake without separation plan
- implementation ecosystem (SIs) should transfer or be rebuildable

## Carve-Out Screening Criteria

### Strong Positive Signals

- seller is conglomerate/strategic doing portfolio pruning
- deal rationale mentions 'non-core' / 'focus on core' / 'divestiture' / 'carve-out'
- target has distinct product lines, geographies, or customer segments with separate P&L
- integration complexity or overlapping suites suggests parts may be redundant
- buyer is private equity roll-up platform (often rationalizes portfolio)

### Strong Negative Signals

- target is single-product, tightly integrated platform with shared infrastructure
- transaction is distressed rescue with heavy operational entanglement
- target is regulated utility core system with high switching cost and bespoke deployments (carve-outs harder)
- highly bespoke services-heavy business with limited transferable IP
